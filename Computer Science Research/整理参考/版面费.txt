Dear Dr. or Prof.XXX
Re Ms@XXXX-XXXX
I am very pleased that our parper for the publication of the manuscript(or for printing the color fingures ,or whatever you are charged),the publication fees(or costs for printing the color fingures ,or whatever you charged)appear too ecpensive for me at the moment . although this project was supported by a grant from ***,but the total amount of the grant was RMBXXX, with this amount ,we could just mange to conduct and complete our experiments .and thus we do not have enough funding wo pay for the publication fees (or for printing the color figures, or whatever you are charged)
	therefore, i am writing you to explore the possibility that the publication fees(or for printing the color figures,or whatever you are charge )could be reduced or even waived,however, if you have a difficulty to offer us such a concession, we will make our every effort to meet there quirements for the publication of this parper in your journal is very important for us.
	thankd very much for your consideration,and look forward to hearing from your soon.
	with kind regards,
	your sincerely,
